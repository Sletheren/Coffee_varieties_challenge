# Arabica Coffee Varieties of the World ☕️

Coffee, that liquid black gold that most developers are completely hooked on and
without it would not be able to function properly. Coffea arabica, or Arabica
coffee, is known all around the world for it great taste. Lesser known is the
fact that Arabica coffee is not just one type of bean, but that it’s a species
that has many, many varieties.

## Coding Assignment

Build a small API using Node.js and with any framework and/or tooling you feel
comfortable with. This API needs to meets the following acceptance criteria:

- It must be capable of returning a list with all varieties;
- It must be capable of returning a list filtering varieties based on any and
all of the values of any and all of their properties. Filters must be applied
using the `AND` operator;
- It must be tested;
- It must be deployable in a production environment;
- It must be documented. From the documentation it must be clear how to run
and use the API as well as explain why your implementation is most favorable.

Included is a very small boilerplate. You can use this (or not) to get started.
